# Slapp

## Project description

Slapp is a habit tracking app designed to improve your sleep quality by helping you establish and maintain healthy sleep habits.  
The web app was designed to conduct statistical A/B testing across different interfaces, including user studies. This allows for data-driven decisions on user experience by comparing performance and satisfaction metrics between interface versions. We used Vite + React + Typescript to implement the webapp.
